        <h3>Pool Party <span>@ 11 AM</span></h3>
        <p>
          Its fall but it will still be warm enough in beautiful Ojai to take part in a bunch of outdoors fun. We will be hanging out by the pool and doing a bunch of fun activites.
        </p>
        <p>
          We will have snacks to munch on throughout the day. We recommend that you eat a hearty breakfast before the party. You should bring your swim suite and sneakers if you want to play Basketball. Please remember to bring a beach towel with you if you plan to lay out.
        </p>

        <h3>Hanging Out <span>@ 11 AM</span></h3>
        <p>We will be hanging out at the estate during the morning/afternoon. We will have some activities setup for those of us who wish to be crafty. Everyone else can just relax and swap stories from the previous night’s awesomeness.</p>

        <img src="images/ceremony.svg" />
        <h3>Seal The Deal <span>@ 5 PM</span></h3>
        <p>The ceremony will be held on the lower lawn of the estate. It is a short walk down and back. </p>
        <p>For those who decide to hang back at their hotel until the ceremony starts: We will be providing a shuttle service from the Blue Iguana Inn from 4PM - 4:40 PM.</p>

        <img src="images/drinks.svg"/>
        <h3>Pre-Gaming <span>@ 5:45</span></h3>

        <h3>Blue Iguana Inn & Suites</h3>
        <p>15 rooms have been blocked out at a rate of $169 a night. If you intend on staying here please book soon as we will not be able to hold the rooms up until the event. On the day of the reception we will be organizing shuttles to the venue from here.</p>

        <div class="bullet"><span>B</span></div>
        <h3>Ojai Valley Inn & Spa</h3>
        <p>Rooms have not been blocked out but should be available. Ojai is considerably more expensive but is an amazing place to lay your head. We stayed here for our anniversery one year and loved it. Shuttles will also be available here.</p>

        <h4>Other Options</h4>
        <h3>AirBnb</h3>
        <p>For those of you traveling in groups, you may find the best deal on AirBnb. We literally vagabonded for 6 months using AirBnb a few years ago and can attest to how well it works.</p>

        <h2>Santa Barbara (SBA)</h2>
        <p>If you can swing it SBA will be the best airport to fly into. It is about 50 minutes away from Ojai. For those flying in on Thursday night, we may be able to arrange someone to pick you up from the airport. Please reach out to us and we will see if we can accomodate you.</p>

        <h2>Los Angeles (LAX)</h2>
        <p>LAX is about 90 minutes away from Ojai without traffic. Its LA, there is usually traffic, so unless you are flying in late at night you will probably want to budget about 2 hours of driving time. </p>
        <p>LAX will be your cheapest option. For family flying from Baltimore, Jennifer’s father will be able to organize a group discount that as of now is $377 round-trip for 5 or more people. Spirit airlines may also be an ever more cost efficient option. If you consider flying Spirit please take note of why its costs are lower and make sure you will not incure additional costs (such as carry on baggage).</p>
        <p>Group travel into LAX is highly recommended as you will be able to save money by carpooling. </p>

      <section>
        <h2>Parking</h2>
        <p>The estate has limited parking and will likely be mostly taken by the guests who will be sleeping at the estate. For this reason we will need to carpool whenever possible when traveling to and from hotels. </p>

        <h2>Shuttles</h2>
        <p>A limited shuttle service will be available to guests on the day of the wedding. We have the shuttle for 3 hours and will have specific windows in which it will take guests to and from the venue.</p>

        <h2>Uber</h2>
        <p>Uber X is available in Ojai and will be a great way to get around without having to worry about parking, shuttle times or drunk driving. The hotels are very close to the property so with enough cordination from other guests (ride sharing) the costs should be minimal.</p>

        <p>We don't need you to bring us gifts – we know plane tickets are expensive and your presence at the wedding is enough! If you really want to give us something, a contribution to our honeymoon fund would be greatly appreciated.</p>
